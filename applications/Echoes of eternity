## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- **Tagline:** A medieval fantasy MOBA/Grind mix where items can oonly be earned in Grind fashion.
- **Description:** "Echoes of Eternity" is a web3 game that blends MOBA and grind-style RPG elements. Players engage in 5v5 battles using champions that can only use items acquired through quests. Set in a medieval world, the game leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security and you will use NFTs as items earned through out the game, and staking as a way to avoid nerfing them as patches are release.
- **Integration with Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama:** The game will use Substrate for its blockchain infrastructure, ensuring secure and transparent transactions for item ownership and marketplace functionalities. By integrating with Polkadot, "Echoes of Eternity" will benefit from interoperability with other projects in the ecosystem.
- **Interest in Project:** Our team is passionate about creating innovative gaming experiences and believes that integrating blockchain technology can revolutionize player engagement and asset ownership in gaming.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Fit in Ecosystem:** "Echoes of Eternity" will be a unique addition to the Polkadot ecosystem, providing a new genre of blockchain-based gaming with a focus on asset ownership and player-driven economy.
- **Target Audience:** Gamers, blockchain enthusiasts, developers interested in game development and blockchain integration.
- **Needs Met:**
  - Secure and transparent item ownership through NFTs.
  - Engaging gameplay that combines MOBA and RPG elements.
- **Identification of Needs:** Based on market research, forum discussions, and user feedback from existing blockchain games.
- **Similar Projects:** While there are other blockchain-based games, "Echoes of Eternity" stands out with its unique combination of medieval and futuristic elements and its focus on a player-driven economy.
- **Related Ecosystems:** Games like Axie Infinity and CryptoBlades have shown the potential of blockchain gaming, but "Echoes of Eternity" offers a distinct gameplay experience.
